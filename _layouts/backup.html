<a name="welcome-to-coderush-plugins" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-coderush-plugins"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to CodeRush Plugins.</h3>

<p>This site is here to provide a simple one stop shop for finding plugins.
Initially I'll be adding the plugins whose source is stored here on github, but I'll also be happy enough to add references to plugins held elsewhere.</p>

<p>So why another site? Don't we already have plugins listed elsewhere?
Well yes, but there are a few advantages to hosting such a site here on guithub.com</p>

<ul>
<li>Markdown - Once I get the hang of it, I understand that it will be very easy to update pages without so much messing around in HTML. I guess we'll see.</li>
<li>Git All The Things! - Push, pull, Reset, <em>cough</em> rebase <em>cough</em> Git all the things.</li>
<li>Push for me, Pull (request) for you - If you think something is missing, let me know. I'm sure I'll be very happy to take Pull requests. :D</li>
</ul><h3>

<p>Yeah someone else has done all the hard work to make this look nice :) That's because you really don't want me messing around with html and css, when there are plugins to be made :D</p>

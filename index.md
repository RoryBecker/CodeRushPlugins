### Welcome to CodeRush Plugins.
This site is here to provide a simple one stop shop for finding CodeRush plugins.
Initially I'll be adding the plugins whose source is stored here on github, but I'll also be happy enough to add references to plugins held elsewhere.

Navigation is Simple:

#### New here?
See [our FAQ](./FAQ.html)

#### Want plugins?

Note: 
This site is regularly refactored. As such certain information may have been duplicated in multiple locations.
Please bear with us as this website's Refactoring and Deduplication tools are nowhere near as good as CodeRush's :)
